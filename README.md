# imputeML: A machine-learning approach to imputing scRNA-seq data
Dropouts refer to the collection of only a small fraction of the cell transcriptome, and it is a common occurrence when collecting scRNA-seq data. Since dropouts make analyzing such data challenging, the development of tools to impute this "missing data" has been neccessary. We introduce a machine learning approach to scRNA-seq data imputation.
